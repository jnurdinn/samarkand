# samarkand
Basic Web Server Written in GoLang. Because it's my first shot on this language, don't expect much out of it.

## Installation :
All you have to do is run the setup.sh script and let the magic happen.

## Configuration :
Configuration can be accessed in :`/etc/samarkand/config.toml` <br>
There are two things you can configure, port and webpage directory, which either is self explanatory. Default port is 80 and default directory is `/var/www/html`

## Uninstall :
To uninstall, just run the uninstall.sh script.
